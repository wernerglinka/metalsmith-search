# metalsmith-search - Development Context

This file gives Claude operational context for working in this plugin. Plugin
behavior is documented in [README.md](README.md) and the architecture
rationale in [docs/THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md) — don't duplicate them here.

## Project Overview

HTML-first Metalsmith search plugin that emits a Fuse.js-compatible index using Cheerio.

ESM-only Metalsmith plugin, published directly from `src/` (no build step),
targeting Node.js 22+. CommonJS consumers can still `require()` it via
Node 22's stable `require(esm)` support.

## MCP Server Integration (CRITICAL)

**IMPORTANT**: This plugin was created with `metalsmith-plugin-mcp-server`.
When working on this plugin, AI assistants (Claude) MUST use the MCP server
tools rather than improvising equivalents.

### Essential MCP Commands

```bash
list-templates                          # See what's available
get-template plugin/CLAUDE.md           # Retrieve exact template content
get-template configs/biome.json
get-template configs/release-it.json
validate .                              # Plugin validation + recommendations
diff-template .                         # Drift check vs current scaffold
configs .                               # Generate config files
show-template release-it                # Reference config templates
update-deps .                           # Dependency update
```

### CRITICAL RULES for AI Assistants

1. **Use MCP server templates verbatim** — never paraphrase or "simplify"
2. **Run `list-templates` before guessing** at template names
3. **When `validate` produces a recommendation, copy it exactly** — including
   the exact command suggested
4. **Ask the user** before modifying `.release-it.json`, `package.json`,
   `biome.json`, or any other `.json` / `.yml` / `.config.js` file
5. **Never set `npm.publish` to `true`** in `.release-it.json` — releases
   here are deliberately manual

## Plugin Development Rules

### Use Metalsmith's native methods

Prefer the methods Metalsmith provides on the instance over external
packages:

```javascript
// ❌                                    // ✅
require('debug')('metalsmith-search')    metalsmith.debug('metalsmith-search')
require('minimatch')(file, pattern)      metalsmith.match(pattern, file)
process.env.NODE_ENV                     metalsmith.env('NODE_ENV')
path.join(dir, file)                     metalsmith.path(file)
```

The validator flags external packages when a native method exists.

### Never mock Metalsmith in tests

Use a real `Metalsmith` instance against a temp directory. Metalsmith is
in `devDependencies` for exactly this reason. Mocking
`metalsmith()`, `metalsmith.match`, `metalsmith.debug`, `metalsmith.env`,
`metalsmith.path`, or plugin invocation has repeatedly hidden integration
bugs that only surfaced in production.

Mocking unrelated systems (network, non-Metalsmith fs concerns) is fine.

### Metalsmith goes in devDependencies, never peerDependencies

The plugin code itself never imports Metalsmith — it receives the instance
as a parameter. Tests import Metalsmith directly. Users have their own
Metalsmith install in their project.

## Pre-commit workflow

Before any commit or release, run in order:

```bash
npm run lint       # Biome: lint + format with autofix
npm run format     # Format only
npm test           # node:test runner against src/
```

If any step fails, fix the underlying issue and re-run. Don't skip hooks.

## Release commands

Only after the pre-commit workflow succeeds:

```bash
npm run release:patch   # Bug fix (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
npm run release:minor   # New feature (1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
npm run release:major   # Breaking change (1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
```

Releases use `./scripts/release.sh` which retrieves the GitHub token from
`gh auth token` and calls release-it. npm publishing is intentionally
manual.

## Before releasing: re-read the user-facing docs

Before any `npm run release:*`, read the user-facing docs end-to-end
and update anything that's drifted from current behavior. This is a
real footgun — drift goes unnoticed during code-focused work, then
ships, then needs a follow-up patch release purely for docs.

Files to audit:

- [README.md](README.md) — installation, usage examples, options, badges
- [docs/THEORY.md](docs/THEORY.md) — architecture and design rationale
- Any other `docs/*.md` files if present

Specific things to grep for: option names and defaults that no longer
match `src/index.js`, code examples that import removed exports,
references to removed CLI flags, "What's New in vX.Y" callouts
referencing past releases, broken links to renamed sections.

If the change being released doesn't actually affect any user-visible
surface (pure internal refactor, dependency bump, test-only fix), say
so explicitly when reporting the audit — don't claim drift you didn't
find. But default to reading.

## Plugin features

This plugin uses standard synchronous processing.

## Tooling

- **Biome** for lint + format (single tool, single config: `biome.json`)
- **node:test** + `node:assert/strict` for testing
- **Native coverage** via `node --test --experimental-test-coverage`
- **Node >= 22** required (for stable coverage reporter destinations)

## When validation flags something

The MCP server's `validate` tool can return:

- `failed` — must-fix (license missing, wrong package shape)
- `warnings` — quality concern (low coverage, stub THEORY.md)
- `recommendations` — optional with exact command to run

Implement recommendations as written. The validator catches real maintainer
feedback patterns (marketing language, hardcoded values that should be
options, CJS examples in ESM-only plugins, performance anti-patterns,
English-only output strings). Run `validate .` and copy the suggested
fixes.
